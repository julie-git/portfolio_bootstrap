<h1>Student Portfolio Bootstrap Edition<h1>
This is a revision of the original Student Portolio site that was written with HTML and vanilla CSS.
Now I am using Boostrap to create a responsive version of the site with no media.

* I created a responsive layouts with Bootstrap Grid
* I made the site responisve by adjusting the column size based on med or large size screen size
* I made a sticky footer
* Used Bootstrap navbar
* Used Responsive Images
* Added previously missing banners to the portfolio page
